# Progress-log
Daily log of my progress as a developer. I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science in 2011, so it's not totally new to me but since almost 10 years has passed, there has been leaps in the tech world I do not know of. My gogal is to work at *a cool tech company* coding but I do not know as what role... what I do know is I lean towards backend. I like solving problems efficiently. I prefer logic vs making things pretty.

I started with solving problem sets on leetcode as people on reddit say that's what you need to pass technical interviews, portfolio not necessary. However, according to a developer for 10+ years, sadly there is a disconnect with interviews and the daily work life of developers. In interviews, they ask more Leetcode type of questions (data structures and algorithms). However, on the job, you'd be working on a codebase, or a project development from start to finish... So, yes, Leetcode is needed to pass interviews but portfolios are definitely needed as practice on what you'll actually be doing. Plus, it's something to discuss in interviews!
